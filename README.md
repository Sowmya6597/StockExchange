Day 7
(08-01-2020)
Java API Documentation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
If a single object behaves differently in different siuations and produce different
results then the object has polymophic nature this concept is called polymorphism
Method Overloading _ It is achieved within class _ Can overload same method with different signature
Method Overriding _ It is achieved in different classes _ Classes must have parent child relationship * Methods must have same name and signature
Constructors
These are special type of methods , which has the same name as that of class name.
It does not have a return type and they are invoked automatically.


	* Same name as that of class name
	* Does not have a return type.
	* Invokled automatically
	* They can be either public or default ,
	 	 can be private in some special cases but never protected
	* These are the property of a class, so can not be inherited.
	* These can not be overrided.
	* Constructors can be overloaded
	* They can never be static


Need:
	    * Constructors are used to initialize the instance variables
		* are used to create Objects.

Types:
		* Default Constructor:
           If we are not creating a Constructor explicitly , then it is responsibility of
           the compiler to create a constructor at complie time , so that the can execute
           easily by the JVM. That Constructor is called Default Constructor.

       	* No-Arg/Non- Parametrized Constructor:
		   When we create a constructor without any parameter , that constructor is called No-Arg Constructor.

   		* Parametrized Constructor:
   		   When we pass parameters in a Constructor , then it is called Parametrized Constructor.
